# Gustelandyard
Attempting to Build the boardgame Scotland Yard in C++
Currently only a command line Application (which doesent really make sense, as you would see the position of Mr.X

I will probably attempt to make a frontend for this at some point.

## ToDo list
- [x] Implement Players
- [x] Implement Map
- [x] Implement Locations
- [x] Implement Basic Game logic
- [ ] Implement 2x Ticket (Including correct pathing history!) (Maybe as 0-turn)
- [ ] Implement ticket usage (and the requirement)
- [ ] Implement announcement of Mr.X position
- [ ] Implement Dummy-Players (if less than 3 detectives)
- [ ] Implement Multiple Map support
- [ ] Check input map for redundant vertices, or handle them at least
- [ ] Create backend API (Do you even call that an API?)
- [ ] Create Frontend
